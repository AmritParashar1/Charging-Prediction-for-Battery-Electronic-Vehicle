--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The electrical grid is the big network of power lines, substations, and power plants that brings electricity from power stations to your home, office, and EV charging stations
When you plug your EV into a charging station, the electricity comes through the grid - from a coal/solar/wind power plant → through transmission lines → to the charging station → to your car battery.
If the grid is unstable (low frequency, power cuts, poor quality), your EV will charge slower or stop charging completely.
During load shedding (power cuts), charging_duration_min increases because charging gets interrupted.
